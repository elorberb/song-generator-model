# song-generator-model
This repository contains code for building a song generator model using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) with PyTorch. The model is trained on a dataset of lyrics and can generate new song lyrics based on the input provided.

## Dataset

The MIDI and lyric data used for training the RNN model are essential components for generating new song lyrics. The dataset, comprising over 50,000 songs from diverse genres and artists, helps the model learn correlations between musical patterns and lyrics, resulting in diverse and representative lyrics.
